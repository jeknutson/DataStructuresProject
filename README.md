To play the game, simply run ./final.py while on one of the student machines. This is because the shebang uses an afs location to access Python 3.6. If the user wishes to run it locally (not on the student machine), the user will have to edit the shebang to access a local version of Python, and ensure they have the PyGame library installed. No additional files are required.

Use the left and right arrow keys to adjust the angle at which you wish the ball to be shot. 
Use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the power with which you wish the ball to be hit.
Press the spacebar to hit the ball.

The goal is to hit the ball in the hole on the right side of the screen starting from the tee on the left side of the screen. Once this has been accomplished, the player is taken to a new hole to achieve the same goal. Score is kept for each of the nine holes, and after completion of the entire 9-hole course, the total score is displayed.
